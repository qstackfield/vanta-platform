🔎 Overview

VANTA Platform powers subscriptions, billing, entitlements, referrals, and capital-linked vault contributions.
Client apps (Web, Mobile, Discord, Telegram) talk to a Gateway API → Auth → Billing → Entitlements → Referral → Notifications.
Backed by Postgres, Redis, Kafka, Vault, and Stripe/BTCPay, every transaction is auditable, replayable, and tied into Vault allocations.

💳 Payment Flows
	1.	Checkout – Client calls POST /v1/billing/checkout-session with tier & addons → Stripe Checkout session created.
	2.	Webhooks – Stripe → checkout.session.completed → invoice.paid → subscription.created → Billing Service updates DB + ledger.
	3.	Proration/Upgrades – Stripe subscription.update with proration rules.
	4.	Refunds/Disputes – Stripe disputes trigger Fraud Service → account hold.
	5.	BTCPay – crypto invoices flow into reconciliation → entitlements unlocked after confirmations.

⸻

🔑 Entitlements
	•	Entitlements Service caches tier features in Redis.
	•	SDK/gateway validates access before feeds, autotrade, or dashboard access.
	•	JWT “ent” claims embed tier + quota for high-throughput services.

⸻

🤝 Referrals & Affiliates
	•	Referral codes generate Stripe coupons.
	•	Referrer gets credit or % revenue share.
	•	Affiliates tracked with links (?aff=AFF123) and payouts via Stripe Connect.
