# VANTA OS - Autonomous Capital Intelligence Stack 🔐📈

VANTA OS isn’t about selling screenshots or “signals.”  
It’s about **Vaults** and **Mirroring** – a new operating system for capital markets.

---

## 🌌 What Makes VANTA Different?
- **Vaults**: capital containers with encoded risk rails, allocations, and personas.  
- **Mirroring**: followers connect their own broker accounts, not their money.  
  - They mirror manager vaults in real time.  
  - They keep custody - VANTA never touches user funds.  
- **Capital-Aligned Fees**:  
  - No flat “subscription.”  
  - Fees come from performance share (% of PnL) or institutional flat fees.  
  - Followers see **PnL vs Fees side-by-side** for transparency.  

---

## 🚀 Why This Matters
- **Transparency** → every order, fee, and result is logged and auditable.  
- **Alignment** → we only win if followers win.  
- **Future-Proof** → cross-asset vaults (equities, crypto, fiat) built for scale.  
- **Custody-Safe** → no pooled funds, no screenshots, no hype. Just mirrored execution.  

---

## 📑 Coming Soon
- API packet onboarding (drop your broker keys + preferences, mirror instantly).  
- Multi-vault persona strategies (e.g., Athena, Apollo, Ares).  
- Capital-aligned dashboards and live audit feeds.  
- Enterprise connectors and partner vaults.
